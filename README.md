## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - For fonts

### What I learned
This challenge helps me to remember what I've learned (HTML & CSS) in my previous term of university.

From this challenge, I finally understand how to use external fonts from Google Fonts. 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit">
```

And I also finally know how CSS Box Model works (margin, border, and padding), as you can see in my `index.css` file that I used to style the HTML page. With these lines of codes, I managed to center-aligned the text inside the white box.
```css
.headline {
    margin-top: 10px;

    width: 260px;
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    font-size: 20px;
    font-weight: 1000;
    text-align: center;

    height: fit-content;
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
```

### Continued development
From this challenge, I realized that there are so many CSS components that I need to explore more in order for me to be a better Front-End Developer. I'll continue to make more of these little challenges as a way to continously implement the things that I've learned.

### Useful resources
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This amazing website gives you definition and  the use of various HTML and CSS components. There are also definitions and docs for other programming languages.
